# Grocery Platform Development Status

## 1. Purpose

This document answers: **What is actually implemented right now?** It records verified implementation/development state and distinguishes it from product requirements, approved architecture, planned work, scaffolding, unfinished work, and unresolved decisions.

Use explicit statuses such as `Implemented`, `Partially Implemented`, `Scaffolded / No Business Logic`, `Planned`, `Blocked / Requires Decision`, and `Not Started`. Avoid vague summaries such as "mostly done." Implementation state is not proof of an approved product decision.

## 2. Current Project Stage

The project is in the **foundation / architecture stage**. The repository contains a standard Django project scaffold, DRF registration, environment-based PostgreSQL configuration, and ten generated domain-app scaffolds. The domain applications contain no verified business functionality.

Versions recorded during project setup were Python 3.12.1, Django 5.0.6, and DRF 3.15.2. `backend/requirements.txt` declares version ranges rather than exact pins. A repository-local `.venv/` exists; its package versions were not separately verified in this status inspection.

The architecture is a modular monolith with domain-oriented Django applications. PostgreSQL is configured as the intended primary database, but this document does not claim a live PostgreSQL server or connection has been verified.

## 3. Repository Foundation

Repository inspection found the following. Items marked **planned** are not present as files/directories at this inspection; `.venv/` is a local ignored environment.

No frontend directory, Dockerfile/Compose file, or CI workflow was found in the repository root/current file inventory.

## 4. Backend Scaffold Status

The `backend/` directory contains `manage.py`, `requirements.txt`, and a standard `config/` project package (`settings.py`, `urls.py`, `asgi.py`, `wsgi.py`). It also contains the ten domain applications listed below.

`settings.py` registers Django's standard applications, DRF, and all ten domain apps. `config/urls.py` routes only Django's standard `/admin/` interface; no `/api/v1/` application route is registered. App files are standard scaffolds: model and view files have no model/view declarations, test files have no test cases, migrations directories contain only `__init__.py`, and no app-level `urls.py` or `serializers.py` files exist.

## 5. Implemented vs Not Implemented

| Area | Status | Verified current state |
|---|---|---|
| Project structure | Implemented | Django project and ten app scaffolds exist under `backend/`. |
| Django configuration | Implemented | Standard settings; DRF and all domain apps registered. Last recorded `manage.py check` passed. |
| PostgreSQL configuration | Partially Implemented | Settings select PostgreSQL from `POSTGRES_*` environment variables when `POSTGRES_DB` is set; otherwise they use SQLite. No PostgreSQL connection is verified. |
| Environment configuration | Partially Implemented | `.env.example` exists and settings read environment variables. No `.env` file was found; no dotenv-loading behavior was verified. |
| `users` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no product user model or authentication flow. |
| `shops` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no shop model or onboarding behavior. |
| `catalog` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no catalog models or review behavior. |
| `inventory` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no inventory behavior. |
| `customers` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no customer identity implementation. |
| `cart` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no cart behavior or persistence. |
| `orders` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no order behavior or state machine. |
| `campaigns` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no campaign behavior. |
| `notifications` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no notification or WhatsApp integration. |
| `analytics` | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | App files exist; no analytics implementation. |
| Authentication | Blocked / Requires Decision | Django's built-in auth app/middleware are in the standard configuration; product authentication architecture and custom flow are not finalized or implemented. |
| Authorization | Blocked / Requires Decision | Final authorization model and permission matrix are not finalized; no product/API authorization implementation was found. |
| Multi-tenancy implementation | Not Started | Shop-level isolation is an approved requirement; no tenant-context or tenant-query enforcement was found. |
| API endpoints | Not Started | No application API endpoints or `/api/v1/` routing; only Django Admin is routed. |
| Database schema | Not Started | No domain model declarations or domain schema were found. |
| Domain migrations | Not Started | Each app has only the generated migrations package initializer; no domain migrations. |
| Security implementation | Partially Implemented | Standard Django middleware is configured. Product-specific authorization, tenant controls, and production security configuration are not verified; settings default `DEBUG` to true. |
| Automated tests | Scaffolded / No Business Logic | Each app has a generated `tests.py`, but inspection found zero test cases. Test execution status is not established by this inventory. |
| CI/CD | Not Started | No `.github/workflows/` directory or CI configuration was found. |
| WhatsApp integration | Not Started | Product requirement is documented; no provider or integration code was found. |
| Payment integration | Not Started | MVP payment is merchant-handled; no centralized gateway is approved or implemented. |
| Storage/media | Not Started | No storage provider or integration was found; provider is not finalized. |
| Analytics implementation | Not Started | Metrics are conceptual in product documentation; no aggregation/reporting code was found. |
| Frontend | Not Started | No frontend/client application directory was found. |
| Docker support | Not Started | No Dockerfile or Compose configuration was found in the inspected repository. |

## 6. Current Django App Status

Repository inspection checked all ten app directories. Each has generated `models.py`, `views.py`, `tests.py`, and `migrations/__init__.py`; none has model/view declarations, test cases, or domain migration files. None has an app-level `urls.py` or `serializers.py`.

| App | App exists | Models | Domain migrations | APIs/business logic | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `users` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `shops` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `catalog` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `inventory` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `customers` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `cart` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `orders` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `campaigns` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `notifications` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |
| `analytics` | Yes | None found | None | None found | Stub only; no cases |

These are scaffolded applications, not implemented domain features.

## 7. Authentication Status

Authentication architecture is not finalized. No specific authentication mechanism should be assumed or implemented without approval. User/account architecture remains pending. Although Django's standard `django.contrib.auth` app and authentication middleware are present in project settings, this is framework configuration, not evidence that product authentication is implemented or approved.

## 8. Authorization Status

The final authorization model and permission matrix are not finalized. Shop-level tenant isolation is an approved requirement, but actual authorization and tenant enforcement should not be assumed complete. No product-specific permission classes or API authorization behavior were found.

## 9. Multi-Tenancy Status

### Approved

- Shop is the primary tenant boundary.
- Merchant-owned data is shop-scoped and must not cross shops.
- Customer identity is shop-specific.

### Implementation

No tenant-context establishment, scoped application querysets, or cross-tenant enforcement was found in the scaffold. The multi-tenancy skill documents the requirement; the skill itself is not implementation. See `.ai/skills/multi-tenancy/SKILL.md`.

## 10. Database Status

### Approved architecture

- PostgreSQL is the primary database.
- Django ORM is the default data-access layer.
- Django migrations are the schema-history mechanism.
- Constraints and indexes should follow documented invariants and real query patterns.

### Current implementation

Domain models and domain migrations were not found. Django settings support PostgreSQL environment variables but fall back to a local SQLite database when `POSTGRES_DB` is unset. `backend/db.sqlite3` was absent during inspection. No seed data was found. A live PostgreSQL service or database connection was not verified.

## 11. API Status

### Approved

- DRF implementation.
- `/api/v1/` version prefix.
- Resource-oriented contracts.
- Serializers for validation and representation.
- Explicit workflow operations where appropriate.

### Current implementation

DRF is declared in `backend/requirements.txt` and registered in `INSTALLED_APPS`. No application endpoints, serializers, app URL modules, authentication wiring, or DRF permission wiring were found. Root URL configuration exposes only Django Admin. API standards are documented in `.ai/skills/api-design/SKILL.md` and `.ai/skills/drf/SKILL.md`; those standards are not endpoint implementations.

## 12. Testing Status

Each app has a generated `tests.py`, but no test cases were found. No domain, API, tenant-isolation, security, or database-constraint tests were found. No CI workflow was found that executes tests. No coverage percentage is established. A Django system check passed during initial project setup; this is not evidence of application test coverage.

## 13. External Integration Status

### WhatsApp

Order notifications and acknowledgements are product requirements. Provider/architecture is not finalized, and no integration implementation was found.

### Payments

MVP payment is merchant-handled. A centralized payment gateway is not approved; no gateway implementation was found.

### Storage / Media

The provider is not finalized. No storage integration was found.

## 14. Domain Implementation Roadmap

The following is a conceptual planning view, not a committed sequence. Dependencies and order may change as domain decisions are approved:

```text

    ↓
Database Design
    ↓
Authentication / Authorization Design
    ↓
Catalog
    ↓
Inventory
    ↓

    ↓
Orders

Notifications
    ↓
Campaigns
    ↓
Analytics
    ↓
Hardening / Testing
```

## 15. Current Blockers / Decisions Required

See `.ai/project-context/business-rules.md` for the canonical unresolved-decision list. Current decisions that block or constrain implementation include:

- Authentication mechanism and authorization model.
- Merchant account/membership model.
- Customer identity mechanism.
- Catalog approval and master-catalog relationship.
- Product/variant structure.
- Inventory deduction, overselling, and low-stock behavior.
- Complete order state machine, cancellation, and refunds.
- Delivery rules, pricing, and zones.
- Payment verification.
- Campaign rules and analytics formulas.
- Deletion, retention, and historical-data behavior.

Do not resolve these by assumption in implementation.

## 16. Do Not Implement Yet

Until corresponding decisions are approved, do not implement final authentication or authorization, final user/membership architecture, detailed order workflows, inventory deduction or overselling rules, a centralized payment gateway, delivery-partner management, microservices, advanced event-driven architecture, or complex ERP accounting. Follow `product.md`, `architecture.md`, and `business-rules.md` for current boundaries.

## 17. Change Tracking

When implementation status changes:

1. Update this file with verifiable current state.
2. Update relevant domain documentation.
3. Update tests.
4. Update architecture or ADR documentation if an architectural decision changes.
5. Keep status factual; planned or discussed work is not implemented work.

## 18. Source-of-Truth Rules

```text
product.md
    = what the product should do

architecture.md
    = how the system is architecturally organized

business-rules.md
    = approved business rules and invariants

development-status.md
    = what is actually implemented right now

skills/
    = how engineering work should be performed
```

When implementation differs from approved documentation, do not silently redefine the product. Identify the discrepancy, update the appropriate source of truth through an approved change, then update implementation and status.

## 19. AI Agent Development Workflow

Before implementing a new task, an AI agent MUST:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `product.md`.
3. Read `architecture.md`.
4. Read `business-rules.md`.
5. Read this `development-status.md`.
6. Read relevant skills.
7. Verify whether the requested functionality is already implemented.
8. Verify required business decisions are finalized.
9. Check the current Git working tree.
10. Ask for clarification if implementation requires an unresolved decision.
11. Implement only the approved scope.
12. Update tests.
13. Update documentation/status when appropriate.

## 20. Git Workflow

Follow the mandatory repository workflow:

```text
git status
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b <task-id>/<short-description>
```

Never work directly on `main`. Inspect existing changes first and do not discard them automatically. Destructive Git commands require explicit approval. Ask for a task ID before creating a branch when none is provided. Keep commits small and task-related, never commit secrets, push the task branch, and create a PR against `main`. Do not force-push or rewrite history without authorization. Follow `AGENTS.md` for the complete workflow.

## 21. What This File Does Not Define

This document records implementation/development status only. It does not define product requirements, business rules, architecture decisions, database schema, API contracts, authentication or authorization design, infrastructure, future implementation estimates, or unapproved technical decisions.

## Final Requirement

Create only `.ai/project-context/development-status.md`. Do not modify application code, models, migrations, APIs, authentication, permissions, or infrastructure. Do not invent implementation status. If repository evidence and documentation differ, report the discrepancy rather than silently resolving it.
